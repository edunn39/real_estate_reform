                <h3>Thesis</h3>
                <p>Real Estate, especially Residential Real Estate, is an incredibly inefficient market. 
                The transaction costs associated with purchasing a home are already high - you don't need to spend an additional 5-6% of the purchase price on real estate agents!
                Our society demands a more efficient real estate transaction process that removes an unnecessary drain on individual citizens seeking the American Dream.</p>
                <h3>Dollars and Sense</h3>
                <p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.statista.com/">Statista.com</a> reports that the residential real estate market is 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/real-estate/united-states#value">$94T</a>, and that over 
                <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/fmo/real-estate/united-states#value">$3T</a> of value will be transacted.
                If real estate agents capture just 5% of this value in fees, that is $150B or $150,000,000,000 per year!
                Surely an industry with a market cap over double the S&P 500 ($44T) can be more efficient than that.
                You wouldn't sell $100 of stock and let your stock broker walk away with $5, would you?

                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>When a seller wants to list a house for sale, the price is determined based on comparable sales recently closed with similar properties such as location, size, and type.
                Redfin and Zillow, two prominent websites for exploring listed homes, have their own estimate of price based on complex algorithms - but even these are not perfect.</p>
                <h3>Price Discovery</h3>
                <p>Instead of psychological pricing warfare, such as listing below market to induce competitive bids, listing above market to find a spendthrift buyer, and subtly hinting
                that an offer should be increased to trigger an escalation clause, we can create an efficient market detailing bids and offers and ensure a transparent transaction</p>
                <h3>Best Offer</h3>
                <p>Offers for homes may have contingencies, including an appraisal contingency, a inspection contingency, or a mortgage contingency.
                Offers may also vary by the close date or escrow amount, and different sellers might prefer different offers depending on the situation.
                But none of this prevents you from comparing offers, and allowing the seller to accept the "best" offer (or none at all).</p>

                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Real Estate Agents are people in the service industry doing their best at their job.
                They deal with buyers and sellers who end up doing neither, and ultimately do not get paid.
                When they do get paid, they might lose more than half of their profits to referral fees and brokerage fees.
                The problem is not the people, it is the system.</p>
                <h3>Representation</h3>
                <p>Traditionally, a home seller is represented by a "Seller's Agent" and a home buyer is represented by a "Buyer's Agent".
                However, both Real Estate Agents are financially incentivized to close the transaction at all costs; otherwise neither Agent earns any money.
                So when it comes to paying someone to represent you in the largest financial commitment of your life, why trust - let alone pay! - someone whose financial motivations directly contradict your own?</p>
                <h3>Aligning Incentives</h3>
                <p>There is no need for Real Estate Agents to buy or sell a home. Here are some people you may actually need:
                <ul>
                    <li>Real Estate Attorney: explain, interpret, and advise on real estate transactions</li>
                    <li>Mortgage Lender: provide financial terms to borrow the money required to purchase a home</li>
                    <li>Home Inspector: inspect the property subject to sale and identify problems that might require resolution</li>
                    <li>Door Opener: open the door to properties for sale if the homeowner, resident, or other appointed individual is unavailable</li>
                </ul>
                Each of these people need to be compensated for their work.
                Traditionally, Real Estate Agents serve the purpose of Door Opener and prospective buyers do not need to pay to visit a property.
                However, with today's tools for exploring homes, you can effectively identify properties that interest you and pay a modest fee to confirm the online representation in person.</p>
